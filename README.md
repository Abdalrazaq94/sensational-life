Our application helps the family who is waiting for a diagnosis for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) for a long time with little to no support in Scotland. 
Built with React / CSS / node.js / HELMET / Express.js / passport / PostgreSQL / HEROKU.
This was the final project for the Code Your Future Full Stack Web Development course in 2022.

## Postgres Dev Setup

You need to run the script
```
npm run dbsetup
```

## Scripts

Various scripts are provided in the package file, but many are helpers for other scripts; here are the ones you'll
commonly use:

- `dev`: starts the frontend and backend in dev mode, with file watching (note that the backend runs on port 3100, and
  the frontend is proxied to it).
- `lint`: runs ESLint and Prettier against all the code in the project.
- `serve`: builds and starts the app in production mode locally.
